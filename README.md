2. Install dependencies and run the app at development mode:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

## Remarks

Note that the number of markers on the map may appear different when zoomed out, as markers that are close to each other may be clustered or overlap. This is a common behavior in maps to improve the visual representation and avoid cluttering the map with too many markers. Zooming in will reveal individual markers in such cases.
